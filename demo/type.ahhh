AHHH This program should be ran in --input mode. It will read out the whole input file to the console.

Hhhh read character to cell 0

HHHH start loop if current cell is not 0

Hhhh cell is non-zero so print it as ASCII
HHhh set current cell to zero

Hhhh read character to cell 0

hhhh end loop

hhh! newline to be nice ;)

WHY? Because I wanted AHHH to be more useful for code-golf-esque challenges
